# ComputerVision
1 Rules and Schedule
In this course, 50% of your grade will be determined by the lab work. There are
five practical assignments, first of which is basically an introduction to MATLAB
session with no obligation to attend (i.e. no contribution to final grade).
However, we believe it is useful if you have had no experience with MATLAB
so far. Remaining four assignments contribute 50% to your lab grade. The rest
50% of your grade is based on a final project. The lab exercises should be done
in groups of two. Each assignment consists of programming tasks, open ended
questions and presenting your results in a report. The code and the report
should be handed in together (e.g. in a zip file), at the given deadlines (given
below). Deadlines are mentioned in each assignment as well. Also, you should
submit a ReadMe file including your name and student identification number,
i.e: John Smith 12345.
